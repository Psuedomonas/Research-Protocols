conical tube(s) 3. 

Tissue Isolation
1. grab mouse by tail with middle and pointer fingers 
    - mouse will move so start near head and move down

2. put mouse in chamber, close lid 

3. gently flood chamber with CO2

4. check reflex to determine state

5. Cut along diaphram, along sternum to neck, down to groin

6. use scissors to disconnect tissue from skin - pin to skin open, limbs parallel 

7. if possible 'hood' mouse with tweasers by pulling neck skin over the face to reveal neck lymph nodes

8. remove lymph nodes
    see diagram - not available at this time
    adipose tissue will float in mouse media 
    lymphatic tissue will sink 


9. remove spleen 
    see diagram - not available at this time
    care not to nick artery/vein 
    bleeding hides nodes


10. Mash tissues over ~70 um filter for ~10 seconds. 

11. Wash with mouse media.
    repeat 3x 8. 


12. Centrifuge @ 3000 for 5 min. Aspirate supernant. 

13. Resuspend in RBC lysis buffer. 
    Incubate for 5 min @ RT 10. Centrifuge @ 3000 for 5 min. Asperate supernant. 

Count Cells with Hemocytometer
1. 10 ul of dye + 1 ul of cell solution 

2. 10 ul of dye + 1 ul of previous solution 

3. Inject 10ul of stained cell solution into hemocytometer 

4. Count under microscope using L technique 

5. After taking a count of all 4 squares, take average 

6. Rinse hemocytometer with DI H2O, dry and store. 

Fix cells
1. place in u-centrifuge tube, if not already 

2. centrifuge in u-centrifuge for 1 min. asperate out supernant 

3. add 1 ml p-formaldahyde

Long term storage 
1. Centrifuge 1 min in u-centrifuge. asperate supernant 

2 store in 1 ml of 70% ethanol 

3 freeze @ -20C
