Methods
Extraction of Lachrymal Tissue
1. Carefully dissect the tissue to be analyzed and remove all traces of adipose tissue

2. Place approximately 0.1g – 1.0g of tissue into a 100 mm petri dish set on ice. The tissue is then diced into small cubes (approximately 2 mm) using two razor blades sliding in opposite directions to provide scissor action.

3. Tissue cubes are placed into a dounce homogenizer (10ml size) plus 5 ml solubilization buffer. The pestle is then plunged 18-20 times to brake up tissue and cells to form a detergent extract. 

    A typical lachrymal gland from an adult ranges 150-200 mg net weight → plenty of tissue (applicable to Rattus norvigus only)
    using Mus musculus 


Clarify Protein Extracts
4. The extract is then placed on a rocking platform and mixed for 30 min. Always keep the extract at 4°C by preforming the mixing on ice or placing the rocking platform in the cold room.

5. The mixed extract is then clarified to remove large particulate matter by centrifuge at > 12,000 x g for 20 min followed by filtration through a 0.22 um syringe filter. (or use 400 x g ???)

Quantitate Protein Content with Bradford Assay
6. The supernatant is quantitated for protein content, diluted to a final concentration of 1-2 mg/ml and stored at -80C until needed for electrophoresis.

    in LN2 (boils at -196C [77K, 321F])


SDS Page
1. Boil Samples for 2-5 min.
2. Transfer to well

    Use extreme care to control for possible contamination


3. Run electrophoresis at 100 V for 75 min

Western Blot
1. Wet Nitrocellulose paper (45 um) in transfer buffer

2. Remove SDS PAGE gel and place in a separate container

    Wash with transfer buffer
    Remove excess SDS
        Soak for 2 min
        Aspirate
        Repeat


3. Place gel in container w/ nitrocellulose

    sandwich between filter paper
    use PVDF for hydrophobic proteins ???

4. Place in cassette and place into transfer chamber.

5. Orient sandwich:

    Nitrocellulose (PVDF) paper on anode side (red)
    gel on cathode side (black)


6. Transblot is run @ 100 V for 90 min.
Antibody Detection
1. Immediately after blotting membrane separated from sandwich.

2. Protein depleted gel is placed into a solution of Coomassie blue or Ponceau S stain to check transfer efficiency.

3. Wash gel 3x with 5:1:5 solution of Methanol : Acetic Acid : Water

4. Gel should be clear of all proteins

5. Membrane containing transferred proteins is first washed with 50 ml of PBST. 

    (Phosphate Buffered Saline [SDS] + Tween 20 or Triton X-100) 
    0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 in 1x PBS
        soak for 30 min
        repeat 3x


6. Washed membrane placed in blocking buffer @ 4°C overnight

    Or about an hour (try 2)


7. Aspirate wash with PBST + soak for 30 min.

8. Dilute 1° antibody with blocking buffer 1:1000 20 ul antiserum : 20 ml solution

    - Membrane incubated with 1° for 2hr @RT. 


9. 1° antibody removed by aspiration and bound membrane is washed. First 2 washes 30 seconds with PBST. 3Rd wash is 15 min followed by two more washes with 5 min soaking intervals.

    The thorough wash is crucial for giving clean responses and should last @ least 15 min.


10. 2° antibody diluted with blocking buffer 1:10000 2 ul : 20 ml solution.

    Bound membrane incubated with 1° antibody for 1 hr @RT


11. Membrane placed top of a sheet of plastic (aspertate sheet) and the chemiluminescence reagent mix is added.

    2nd piece of sheeting placed on top and air bubbles are carefully removed by “squeegee' action.
    Place sandwich into auto-radiography cassette with film. Expose film between 2-30s, for low abundant protein exposure can be extended to 2 min.
