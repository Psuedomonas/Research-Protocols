Setting up a program for the HPLC pump

    Press menu button

    Navigate to files with the arrow buttons and press the enter button

    Select edit

    Press the + or – key to select the program to change

    To change file name:

        Use up and down arrow keys to navigate to file name.

        Use + and – keys to change letter, number in the selected character space

        Use left and right arrow keys to move to the next character space

    To change solvent program, press the enter key with the desired file selected.

        Use up and down arrow keys to select “Solvent Program,” then press the enter key

        Use left and right arrows to navigate between time, %A, %B, and Flow rate

        Use + or – keys to adjust these values and press the enter button to confirm change.

            Program changes through points set in the program with a linear gradient. See example below


The program shown in Example 1 will run for 15 minutes. From program start to 6 minutes the %A will gradually change from 10% to 50% with a flow rate of 0.80. As the program run time reaches 12 minutes the %A will have gradually risen to 75% and the flow rate will have gradually risen to 1.00. After 12 minutes the program will gradually increase the %A to 100% and decrease the flow rate to 0.50. When the program has run for 15 minutes it will reach 100% buffer A, a flow rate of 0.50 and will shut down or restart.

Example 1: A solvent program
Time  %A  %B  Flow
0     10  90  0.80
6     50  50  0.80
12    75  25  1.00
15    100 0   0.50


    Use the program models bellow as a basis for your program

HPLC Pump Program design for Single Run (or bringing a column out of stored solution for sample runs)

*Should provide the desired experimental/purification gradient

*Should end with column be placed in a solvent that the column can be stored with.

*Note that the default program named SHUTDOWN will not restart when finished; instead, this program holds its last solvent concentration. This makes the program useful as a single run program

Example 2: A single run program
Solvents: A: Acetonitrile. B. ddH2O
Time  %A  %B  Flow
0     10  90  0.80    Program Start
15    90  10  0.80    Sample Run
20    100 0   1.00    End of Sample Run
25    100 0   1.00    Clean column

Example 3: A program to recover column from storage solution for sample run(s)
Time  %A  %B  Flow
0     100 0   1.00    A column storage solution
10    10  90  1.00    Solvent Concentration for sample run(s)


Example 4: A program to prepare column for storage
Time  %A  %B  Flow
0     10  90  1.00  Program Start (an example concentration)
10    100 0   1.00  Bring Column to storage solution
20    100 0   1.00  Clean Column


HPLC Pump Program design for Multiple Runs

*Should provide the desired experimental/purification gradient

*Should have a re-equilibration step where the solvents are brought to the programs initial concentrations over a gradient

*A separate program will need to be made to bring the solvent concentration one that the column can be stored with.

*The user defined program (currently called SMBNZ) automatically re-initializes after a rung

Example 5: Multiple Sample Run HPLC Pump program
Solvents: A: Acetonitrile. B. ddH2O
Time  %A  %B  Flow
0     10  90  0.80  Program Start
15    90  10  0.80  Sample Run
20    100 0   1.00  End of Sample Run
30    100 0   1.00  Re-equilibration (clean column)
35    10  90  1.00  Return to start conditions
